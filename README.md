## Meet the Robot ü§ñ

Our task was a simple one‚Äîdesign, build and test a robot for shepherding Stanford sheep (frosh) through their academic careers (from one side of a table to the other). The rules were simple: the robot must fit in a 12‚Äù cube. And a bunch of other rules, but details...
#### MVP/Beat the Brick üß±
For our MVP robot, we used very slow motors, a 3D-printed claw, and a set of 5 IR sensors to navigate through the treacherous maze of Stanford academia.

Three sensors were placed in the center of the robot to sense deviations from the line (career path- CS of course), and two sensors were placed at the far edges of the robot in order to sense junctions and holes in the course. We divided the course up into zones to create a smaller state machine; each zone corresponded to a different ‚Äòtrip‚Äô condition for our robot to look out for in order to execute the next turn.

The claw used a servo in order to open and close at the right points in our state machine. To set up this functionality, we had to calibrate the servo to understand what angle corresponded to an open and closed claw. The claw itself used a pair of 3D printed gears to translate the movement of the servo to opening and closing the claw with the right amount of force to trap our ‚Äòsheep‚Äô in their pen without decapitation.

We initially installed faster motors on our robot, however we quickly realized this made it very difficult for us to create reliable line following code. To combat this we switched out our motors for a much slower set without encoders that gave the robot enough time to react to deviations in the path (sophomore year crisis when they think they might do Symbolic Systems instead of CS).

##### Abstraction

To make our code modular and abstract out lower level functionality, we implemented a multple levels of abstraction. The highest level was the '''system.h''' class which included instantiation of a Chassis class (to handle robot wheel actuation), a Claw class, and Sensors struct with all of our sensors. 

```

struct System
{
public:
  struct Sensors
  {
    struct LineSensors
    {
      LineSensor left = LineSensor(LINE_LEFT);
      LineSensor center_middle = LineSensor(LINE_CENTER_MIDDLE);
      LineSensor center_left = LineSensor(LINE_CENTER_LEFT);
      LineSensor center_right = LineSensor(LINE_CENTER_RIGHT);
      LineSensor right = LineSensor(LINE_RIGHT);
    };
    LineSensors line;

    struct UltrasonicSensors
    {
      UltrasonicSensor front = UltrasonicSensor(15);
      UltrasonicSensor periscope = UltrasonicSensor(15);
    };
    UltrasonicSensors ultra;
  };
  Sensors sensors;
  Chassis chassis = Chassis(RIGHT_FORWARD_PIN,
                            RIGHT_BACKWARD_PIN,
                            LEFT_FORWARD_PIN,
                            LEFT_BACKWARD_PIN,
                            ENCODER_RIGHT_PIN1,
                            ENCODER_RIGHT_PIN2,
                            ENCODER_LEFT_PIN1,
                            ENCODER_LEFT_PIN2,
                            HUB_TO_HUB_DISTANCE,
                            WHEEL_CIRCUMFERENCE,
                            MOTOR_MIN_SPEED);
  Claw claw = Claw(SERVO_PIN, OPEN_CLAW_ANGLE, CLOSE_CLAW_ANGLE);

  void activity(void);
};

extern struct System shephard;
```

The Chassis class held instantiation of a Motor class or an EncoderMotor class which is a subclass of Motor with added functionality to handle checking the hall sensors used by the encoder. Within the Sensors struct, we instantiate all of our sensor classes which each provided simple interfaces to get data from the sensors. For instance, within the linesensor class we have the function 

```
int LineSensor::read()
{
  int value = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  {
    value += analogRead(pin);
  }
  value /= 10;

  if(value <= lineThreshold){
    return 0;
  }
  else{
    return 1;
  }
}
```

which uses a simple sensor averaging technique to reliably return a binary response indicating weather the sensor is over black tape or not. 


## De-Scoped Subsystems

#### Beacon Sensing
We implemented some fancy circuits for detecting an IR beacon for navigation through the wild offroad (off-the-black-line) regions of the game arena. We ultimately decided not to include these in the final robot because of large variations in the beacons in the arena, which made reproducible performance difficult.

#### Crane Elevator
We designed a very large mechanism for moving the claw 12‚Äù up to a basket for double points. The official rules stated ‚Äúyour robot may be dismembered to conform to this specification‚Äù‚Äîthis was a point of contention among many of the contenders. We interpreted this as ‚Äúyour robot may have some of its members detach during the weigh-in (fitting)‚Äù. The referees ruled that this interpretation was fraught, so we descoped this subsystem. Do datasheets have jokes in them? That would be funny.

## Competition Robot
Mere days before the competition, after a 1am caffeine fueled work session, various members of our team came to the depressing realization that neither the crane nor the beacon sensors were going to work in time for the Final Competition. Consequently we returned to our MVP, and brainstormed different ways to make our beautiful robot ready for the real world. This took the form of returning to the faster motors, but this time we decided to make full use of the encoders. As our encoders were relatively accurate, we were able to zoom across the obstacle course, ignoring the lines and the holes, taking 22 units every quarter to place our Stanford sheep in their pen (Facebook/ Microsoft/ Google internships). We tried to use the encoders to return our robot to their starting position, however this movement was much less accurate due to the variability of the board, the robot starting position and how the robot turned. If we had more time (like 3 more hours) we would have combined our line sensing with the encoders in order to ensure that our robot returned to the exact same position each time.

## Lessons Learned
- It's a good idea to read the design specification very carefully and understand when something is sarcastic (bloody Americans who don‚Äôt know how to use sarcasm properly).
- We tried to literally ‚Äúthink outside the box‚Äù but it would‚Äôve turned out better for us if we‚Äôd tried to think inside the box. Maybe this is a Stanford thing. IDK if this is good advice for the real world.
- 3d printing is more flexible since you can do geometries that have 90¬∞ angles in them (like brackets), as well as totally custom geometry
